# Aquamacs integration with MailMate

MailMate bundle allowing the usage of Aquamacs as a text editor for
composing emails.  This is a modification of Alexandru Nedelcu's
`emacs.mmbundle`, which only works for standard Emacs, because the
pathnames are hard-coded.

While composing an email the action is available as:

- Menu Item: Command → Aquamacs → Edit
- Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+O

## Installation

This bundle isn't part of the official distribution, so you can
install it manually like this:

```
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/MailMate/Bundles 
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/MailMate/Bundles 
git clone https://github.com/rpgoldman/emacs.mmbundle
```
